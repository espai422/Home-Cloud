# Test

Here we have the tests but if other folders have a lot of content, we should create 
a test directory in all project parts

# Libraries

We are using **Mocha** and **Chai** to create our tests.

### Mocha

To install Mocha use the following command:

`npm install -D mocha`

### Chai

To install Chai use the following command:

`npm install -D chai`

We are also using chai-http to make chai able to test our endpoints

`npm install -D chai-http`

We are saving this libraris as as develop library instead of a project library so we need to specify the -D flag.
